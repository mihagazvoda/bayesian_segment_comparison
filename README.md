# bayesian_segment_comparison

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `bayesian_segment_comparison` is to use Bayesian methods (ok, linear regression) to assess whether the change happened in some segment compared to the others after some date. 

## TODO

* Maybe use `tidybayes` instead of `rethinking`?
* Does it make sense to assess the average difference between predicted and actual?
* How good can we actually predict?
